# Bank Accounts

Design and Implement a simple program that represents customer’s bank accounts. Customer should be able to check balance, deposit money to the accounts and withdraw money from the accounts. The bank provides Current accounts and Savings accounts. Current accounts allow £100 overdraft. Savings accounts do not allow overdraft but offers 0.5% interest rate. The program should be able to calculate the interest the customer earned.
Notes:

- Interest earned can be simply calculated as (balance)*(interest rate).
- You must consider the inheritance hierarchy in your design.
- Data validation should be considered.
- Separate header file, source code file and main program.
- Consider Class encapsulation and information hiding.
- Use appropriate data types.
